# About starting the application

- The files start_tdt_apps.sh and stop_tdt_apps.sh contain a script that will start and stop all the services. 

- Once you have cloned the repo, and navigated to the main folder (they-doing-that) run the following command to grant execute permissions to both files: 

```
chmod +x start_tdt_apps.sh
chmod +x stop_tdt_apps.sh
```

- Then to start the applications use **./start_tdt_apps.sh** and **./stop_tdt_apps.sh** to stop them
